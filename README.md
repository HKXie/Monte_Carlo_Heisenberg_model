# Monte_Carlo_Heisenberg_model
Based on Heisenberg model, do Monte Carlo simulation calculation for MnBi2Te4 to produce magnetization and susceptibility.  
MnBi2Te4 is a topological material with A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure, the interaction between layers are positive(antiferromagnetic), and it's negetive in the layer(ferromagnetic),as the figure 1 shows. The Hamiltonian for the spin system in MnBi2Te4 can be written as:  
The spin system follows a Boltzmann distribution, expressed as:
