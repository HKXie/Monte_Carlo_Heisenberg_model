# Monte_Carlo_Heisenberg_model
Based on Heisenberg model, do Monte Carlo simulation calculation for MnBi2Te4 to produce magnetization and susceptibility.  
MnBi2Te4 is a topological material with A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure, the interaction between layers are positive(antiferromagnetic), and it's negetive in the layer(ferromagnetic),as the figure below shows:

The J' is ferromagnetic interaction, and the J is antiferromagnetic. D is Anisotropic energy. H is external magnetic field along z axis.  
The Hamiltonian for the spin system in MnBi2Te4 can be written as:

The spin system follows a Boltzmann distribution, expressed as:

The beta is -1/kT, where k is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.  
We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to simulate the magnetization at different temperature or magnetic field.  
We can't sample from the Boltzmann distribution directly for the whole spin system because the partial function it's difficult to calculate and the state space for system is infinite.  
We use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate the Markov chain for the spin system. The state transition function can be written as:  
  
*p*(s,s’) = *q*(s,s’)*a*(s,s’)  
  
Where the *q*(s,s’) is proposal distribution and the *a*(s,s’) is acceptance distribution.  
The a(s,s’) can be expressed as  
  
*a*(s,s’) = min{1, p(s’)q(s’,s)/p(s)q(s,s’)}  
  
We can choose the proposal distribution p(s,s’) to be the Gaussian distribution form. 
  
q(s,s’)=N(s,σ)  
q(s',s)=N(s',σ')  
  
the s and s' is the spin direction at t and t+1 respectively, if we control the cone width sigma(σ) and σ' to be the same, the a(s,s') can be simplified as  
  
*a*(s,s’) = min{1, p(s’)/p(s)}  
  
because the proposal distribution q(s’,s) and q(s',s) are symmetric.  
Although the p(s) can not be calculted directly, the ratio of the state  p(s’)/p(s) can be expressed as  
  
p(s’)/p(s) = exp(-H(s)/kT)/exp(-H(s')/kT)  
  
which is easy to calculate.  
How do we choose the right sigma(σ)? we can simply set it to a random constant, while acceptance rate for the Markov chain sampling is difficult to contral. It will be too low or high, which are unfavorable for effective sampling.  
To solve this problem, we can use a adaptive algorithm for the Gaussian move for the proposal distribution transition in spin system [1]. A golden rule when using the Metropolis algorithm states that 
an acceptance rate of 50% is ideal to efficiently sample the phase space of the system.  
To keep the acceptance rate *R* at the level of 50%, we can establish a relationship bewteen *R* and sigma, by using a high cone width (σ = 60) in the first Monte Carlo (MC) step. From then on, every MC step, the cone width σ is recalculated by multiplying the current cone width σ by a factor obtained according to the acceptance rate in the previous MC step. It is possible to observe that a good approximation for the factor (*f*) as a function of the acceptance rate *R*at all temperatures is of the form:  
*f* = 0.5/(0.5×2-R)
